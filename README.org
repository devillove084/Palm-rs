* Palm-rs
A rust implementation for [[http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol4/p795-sewall.pdf][Palm: Parallel architecture-friendly latch-free modifications to b+ trees on many-core processors]], a lock-free parallel in-memory B+-tree.

** Benchmark [fn:1]
- queries drawn from uniform dist (~INT_MIN~INT_MAX~): ~10M queries/sec
- sorted queries: ~30M queries/sec
  
[fn:1] all experiments are carried out in AWS m5.8xlarge instance (16 physical cores, 128 GB RAM)
There is quite a performance gap, as sorting is yet to be parallelized.
